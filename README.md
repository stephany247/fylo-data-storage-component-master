## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - For styles


### What I learned

While working on this project, I deepened my understanding of Tailwind CSS, particularly in handling background images, responsive layouts, and utility-first styling. Below are some key takeaways:

1. Positioning Without absolute: Rather than relying on absolute positioning, I used flexbox and grid for better layout control. For example, centering elements was done using:

```html
<div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-screen gap-4"></div>

```

2. Creating a Triangle Shape with Tailwind
Instead of custom CSS, I used Tailwindâ€™s border utilities to create a small triangle:
```html
<div class="hidden md:block absolute top-2 right-8 border-l-28 border-l-transparent border-t-28 border-t-white"></div>
```
3. Gradient Progress Bar Without absolute
I implemented a gradient progress bar without using absolute positioning, ensuring a clean layout:

```html
<div class="w-4/5 h-2 ml-[3px] rounded-full bg-gradient-to-r from-[hsl(6,100%,80%)] to-[hsl(335,100%,65%)]">
  <div class="size-2 bg-white rounded-full ml-auto"></div>
</div>
```


### Continued development

As I continue refining my frontend skills, there are a few key areas I want to focus on in future projects:

- Improving Accessibility (a11y) in UI Design
I want to ensure my projects are as accessible as possible by using semantic HTML alongside Tailwindâ€™s accessibility utilities.
Testing designs with screen readers and improving keyboard navigation.

- Working with Tailwind and PostCSS
For future projects, Iâ€™d like to integrate PostCSS with Tailwind to optimize styles and improve performance. Explore custom configurations beyond the default Tailwind setup.

- Building More Dynamic UI Components
I also plan to:
- Experiment with Tailwind + JavaScript for interactive elements.
- Try DaisyUI or other Tailwind component libraries to speed up development.

By focusing on these areas, I aim to write cleaner, more efficient code and build more polished frontend projects. ðŸš€
